## About me

I am Guilherme Schmidt, currently in my first year as a computer engineering student at University of SÃ£o Paulo. In 2022 I graduated as a mechanic, having knowledge mainly about fabrication methods (milling and welding), materials engineering, and mechanical design through Inventor and Autocad. During 4 years I've worked on an Astronomy research project, having published 2 articles and acquired practical experience in the use of telescopes.

## Languages I've worked with

- C/C++
- C#
- Python

## Current works

Currently, I am working on developping a unix sockets communication library, for embedded systems, and a website page using React and Node.js. Besides, as a personal project, I am trying to create a procedurally generated solar system in Unity.

## Past experiences

In the past, I have designed both a planetary gearbox with 1:1029 reduction ratio, and an equatorial support for a Meade LX90 telescope using Inventor, the later being actually produced and used in an observatory. More on the practical side, I welded some railings to be used in the laboratory.

Regarding coding experience, most have been small projects using Unity, in order to facilitate the visualization of some physical concepts, like wave reflections and gravitational forces in star system. More recently, I've produced a Sudoku game as my first C coding project.

Form 2018 to 2022, I've worked in an observatory (OAIG, specifically), aquiring some knowledge about astronomy and astrophotography.
