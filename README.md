## About me

I am Guilherme Schmidt, currently in my second year as a computer engineering student at University of SÃ£o Paulo. In 2022 I graduated as a mechanic, having knowledge mainly about fabrication methods (milling and welding), materials engineering, and mechanical design through Inventor and Autocad. During 4 years I've worked on an Astronomy research project, having published 2 articles and acquired practical experience in the use of telescopes.

## Languages I've worked with

- C
- Python
- Java
- C#
  
## Current works

Currently, I am working on updating my old Sudoku game to improve code legibility, decrease memory use, and reduce runtime when generating games.

## Past experiences

Regarding coding experience, most have been small projects using Unity, in order to facilitate the visualization of some physical concepts, like wave reflections and gravitational forces in star system. More recently, I've produced a Sudoku game as my first C coding project. I develloped a unix sockets communication library, for embedded systems, and updated a website page using React and Node.js.

In the past, I have designed both a planetary gearbox with 1:1029 reduction ratio, and an equatorial support for a Meade LX90 telescope using Inventor, the later being actually produced and used in an observatory.

Form 2018 to 2022, I've worked in an observatory (OAIG), aquiring some knowledge about astronomy and astrophotography.
